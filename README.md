# Whiteleg-shrimp-EEG-and-behavioural-analysis
Scripts for the analysis of EEG CSV files generated from LabChart, which are based on electrophysiological recordings of P. vannamei in response to different slaughter methods (cold-shock and electrical stunning with cold shock, plus electrical stunning alone), for application in a commercial setting. Data was in total power for frequencies between 0.5-32hz, and then separated out into Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta frequencies. CSV files were exported from Labchart and the time column was manually changed to "hh:mm:ss" for each file, and was subsampled at every second. For data subsampled at 0.5 s, CSV time data was formatted to "hh:mm:ss.0".
Scripts also include the plotting of behavioural data, which is based on an ethogram including a suite of behaviours that were observed after shrimp were electrically stunned. The behaviours that were analysed and plotted were time taken to reach coordinated pleopod movement after stun (stage 2, where stage 1 is immobility), and time taken to reach a righted position (stage 3). Animals were tested over a period of 3 mins.
